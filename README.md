# Interior-design
I'm trying to create a webpage using HTML and CSS. This page suggests some ideas related to home interior design.

This webpage is divide in two sections.
In the first section there are some information and layout of the webpage with the login page in the bottom.
In the second section there are some samples images of the interior designs for the different section of the house.

I have made two files of html, one is index.html(the layout page) and other one is working.html(the sample design page) and linked both of them with anchor tag in the nav-bar so when the user clicked on the "Design Ideas" from the top nav-bar section the samples of designs is display.

Tech stack: HTML5 CSS.
